<div class="about-desc">
    Welcome to the ultimate showcase of real, human-made art—while it still lasts! With 16,000 artists creating stunning, weird, thought-provoking masterpieces, this site is proof that creativity isn’t dead yet (no matter what AI tries to tell you). Here, every brushstroke, pixel, and sculpture carries passion, personality, and a touch of beautiful imperfection—things no algorithm can truly replicate. It's a vibrant, messy, and brilliant celebration of artistic talent, brought to life by people, not prompts.

    So, before AI floods the internet with flawless-but-soulless images, take a moment to experience the real deal. Dive into the work of artists who still dare to dream, paint, and create with actual feelings. Whether you're here to browse, get inspired, or support the movement, one thing’s for sure: this is art worth enjoying before the robots take over.

<div class="about-desc">
    I made this website to rekindle my own personal passion with arts. Everyday I come back to browse an unfiltered stream of new artworks I have personally never seen and artists I have never heard about. I believe browsing arts like this has a very theraputic and surreal effect. When I browse the selection of arts from an artist I feel like I can see the world through their eyes. Its very nice to be able to see everything they have made all together.

    The website itself might be very simple and barebones but thats how I prefer it. Sometimes too many fancy details could reduce how much joy you get from the main thing. In this case, the main point of the website is to view as much art as possible, while reducing time wasted clicking random links. <br>

    Hopefully you can take as much from this website as you want. I hope you like how snappy it is to just enjoy some art!
