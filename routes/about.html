    I made this website to rekindle my own personal passion with arts. Everyday I come back to the website to browse an unfiltered stream of new artworks I have personally never seen and artists I have never heard about.

    I believe browsing arts like this has a very theraputic and surreal effect. When I browse the selection of arts from an artist I feel like I can see the world through their eyes. Its very nice to be able to see everything they have made all together. <br>
    
    The website itself might be very simple and barebones but thats how i prefer it. Sometimes too many fancy details could reduce how much joy you get from the main thing. In this case, the main point of the website is to view as much art as possible, while reducing time wasted clicking random links. 

    <br>
    Hopefully you can take as much from this website as you want. I hope you like how snappy it is to just enjoy some art!
